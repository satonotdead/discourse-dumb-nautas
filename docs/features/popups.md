# Desktop pop-ups

A small card in the top-right corner when you get a notification. It shows the person's avatar, the topic title and a preview. Click it to jump there, or close it. It stays put while you hover over it or tab to it.

- Each member turns it on under Preferences → Account.
- Desktop only, and quiet during Do Not Disturb.
- You can leave out some kinds of notification, such as likes, for everyone (`popup_notifications_excluded_types`).
- Works with the keyboard and screen readers, and respects reduced motion.

  # strings produced by substituting each content word with its top
  # synonym from the dictionary. The original term is NOT included in
  # the returned list — callers run the original separately and merge.

  # Operator tokens (`category:foo`, `tags:bar`, `@username`, `#tag`,
  # `in:title`, etc.) are preserved verbatim — only bare content words
  # get expanded. This keeps Discourse's advanced search syntax working
  # untouched when smart-search is on.

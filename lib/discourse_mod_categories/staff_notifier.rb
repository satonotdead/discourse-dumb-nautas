  # Shared fan-out of high-priority custom Notifications + live MessageBus
  # alerts to every other staff member. Used for the three "staff event"
  # streams that are NOT topic-attached private notes:
  #   - actions on a post (delete / approve queued / reject queued)
  #   - notes added on a user's profile (discourse-user-notes)
  #   - notes added to a flag / reviewable in the review queue
  #
  # The notification carries the same `mod_note: true` marker the topic-
  # note flow uses, so the existing client renderer
  # (assets/javascripts/discourse/lib/mod-note-notification.js) and the
  # shield-tab unread counter pick these up alongside topic notes. The
  # `mod_note_kind` field tells the renderer which label/title to show.

    # approve, the ReviewableNote insert, the user-note save) NEVER 500s
    # because the staff fan-out had a problem. Notifications are
    # best-effort by design; the user's action must succeed regardless.
    # The rescue is intentionally swallowing — a broken notifier should
    # log and let the request return 2xx, not bubble out to the
    # controller. Specs in spec/requests/staff_event_integration_spec.rb
    # exercise this contract by injecting `fan_out` raises and asserting
    # the user's endpoint still returns success.

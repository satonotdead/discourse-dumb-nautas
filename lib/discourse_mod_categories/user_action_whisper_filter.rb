module DiscourseModCategories
  # Filter whisper UserAction rows out of a user's public activity feed for
  # viewers who are not in the whisper audience. A whisper post is one whose
  # `posts.id` has a `mod_whisper_target_user_ids` post_custom_fields row —
  # key presence marks it, even with an empty `[]` value. The audience rules
  # mirror `GuardianExtensions#can_see_post?` and `WhisperQueryFilter`:
  #
  #   visible = post is not a whisper
  #           OR viewer is staff
  #           OR viewer is the post author
  #           OR viewer id appears in the post's explicit user targets
  #           OR viewer is a member of one of the post's target groups
  #           OR viewer holds one of the post's target badges
  #
  # Anything that doesn't match is filtered. Anonymous viewers never see
  # whispers.
  #
  # `UserAction.stream` returns an Array of UserAction-like rows already
  # joined to posts/topics, so the filter runs in Ruby against the array
  # rather than reshaping the underlying SqlBuilder. This loses an exact
  # page count when a stream page contains whispers (a 30-row page becomes
  # e.g. 28 visible rows), which is acceptable — correctness of visibility
  # outranks pagination precision, and the next-page link still works
  # because the SQL window is unchanged.

    # Returns a new array containing only rows whose target_post is visible
    # to viewer per the whisper visibility rules above. Falls back to the
    # "hide every whisper" on any error so an upstream Discourse change can
    # neither 500 the /u/{user}/activity page nor leak through it.

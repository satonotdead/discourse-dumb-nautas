# frozen_string_literal: true
# discourse-dumb-nautas sub-plugin: REQ-PM — exchange contact details instead of messaging.
#
# REQ-PM lets members reach each other: everyone keeps a small "contact card" (phone, text, WhatsApp,
# email, website, … or their own custom ones), and can
#
#   * send someone selected details from it, or
#   * request someone's details — that person picks which ones (if any) to
#     send back.
#
# There is no free text anywhere in the exchange, so it cannot turn into a
# private message channel. Values are encrypted at rest and are only ever
# returned to their owner and to the people the owner chose; staff get no
# view of them, not through the UI, the API, or impersonation.

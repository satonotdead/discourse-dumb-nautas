# Jtech Tools

Maintained edition by Criptonautas, based on [JTech-Forums/JtechTools](https://github.com/JTech-Forums/JtechTools) with our own fixes and additions. The plugin keeps the internal name `jtech-tools`, so clone it into that folder.

One Discourse plugin with everything JTech Forums runs on top of core. Ten features, each with its own on/off switch in **Admin → Settings → Jtech**.

## Supported versions

Requires Discourse 3.0+. Cores older than 2026.8 get a pinned commit via `.discourse-compatibility`; 2026.8 and newer track `main`.

## Install

```bash
cd /var/discourse
# add to containers/app.yml under hooks → after_code → cmd:
#   - git clone https://github.com/satonotdead/discourse-dumb-nautas.git jtech-tools
./launcher rebuild app
```

Master switch: `jtech_enabled`. Every feature below also has its own switch, so you can turn things off one at a time.

## What's in it

### Disteleplus — team chat, bridged to Telegram
A private one-room chat inside Discourse for staff (or any groups you allow), mirrored both ways with a Telegram group.

- Opens as a small drawer bottom-right (like Discourse Chat) or full page; always full page on phones.
- Messages, replies, edits, deletes, reactions, images, files, video, voice notes (record right in the composer), polls from Telegram.
- Right-click a message: react, reply, copy text, copy link, quote into a new topic, edit, delete. Double-tap to react.
- `@mentions` and `:emoji:` suggestions, emoji picker, paste or drag files in, drafts kept while you browse.
- Search across the conversation. Link previews. "Someone is typing" indicators.
- Unread badge on the header icon and in the browser tab; notifications only when you're @mentioned.
- Message text is encrypted in the database.
- Telegram side: people you map post as their Discourse account; everyone else shows with their Telegram name. Discourse messages arrive in Telegram with the author's name linked to their profile.
- Optional: announce new forum posts into the Telegram group (by category / tag).
- Optional: mirror the review queue (flags, posts awaiting approval) into a **Reports** Telegram topic — created by the plugin itself, never General — with **Approve / Deny / More** buttons. Presses work for staff mapped by numeric Telegram ID, or for chat admins whose Telegram username matches a staff account.
- When someone reacts in Discourse, Telegram gets a quiet "**Name** reacted 👍" reply under the message, since the bot's own single reaction can't say who it was.
- Setup is done from inside Telegram with `/disteleplus_setup`; there's a "send test message" button and problems show on the admin dashboard.

### Moderator tools
- **Whispers** — reply to specific people inside a topic; others don't see it.
- **Private notes** on topics, with reply threads, visible to staff only.
- **Staff alerts** — every moderator is told when someone deletes a post, approves/rejects a queued post, adds a user note or a flag note. Shows in the bell and in a shield tab.
- **Checklists** — first-post checklists, targeted checklists for specific users/groups, topic prompt checklists.
- **Topic tools** — pinned messages in topics, footer messages, reply approval.
- Every one of these rights is its own toggle.

### Mini-mod
Gives category moderators (people who moderate a category through a group) extra powers normally reserved for staff: create/edit categories, edit and move topics, manage tags, etc. Each power is a separate switch.

### Dislike (phantom reactions)
In categories you pick, likes stop mattering: they're hidden from history, don't count toward leaderboards, and the like notification is quietly removed. Optionally hide the like button entirely or allow it only for certain groups.

### Smart search
When a search finds too little, it quietly retries with synonyms (English dictionary + a short list of tech abbreviations like `js`/`javascript`, `k8s`/`kubernetes`) and merges the results. Runs locally, no API keys. If anything goes wrong you just get normal search results.

### Desktop pop-up notifications
A small card in the top-right corner when you get a notification, with the person's avatar, the topic title and a preview. Click it to jump there. Desktop only, each user turns it on in their account settings.

### Dumbcourse
A simplified web app version of the forum at `/dumb` for basic devices: reading, replying, reactions, push notifications, spell check, and a leaderboard (set `dumbcourse_leaderboard_id` to a discourse-gamification leaderboard; 0 hides it). Uses the forum's own reactions and custom emoji.

Spell check ("Refine") sends the draft text to the LanguageTool server configured in `dumbcourse_languagetool_url` / `dumbcourse_languagetool_api_url`. It's off by default; only turn it on for a server you trust with users' drafts.

### Another SMTP
Send forum email through a different mail server than the one in `app.yml` — host, port, TLS, login, and optional "from" address rewriting, all from admin settings.

### Translator tweaks
Small fixes on top of the official Translator plugin (better foreign-language detection, backfill for old posts).

### Username avatar
Default (non-uploaded) avatars are derived from a user's **username** instead of their email address, so they no longer depend on whether — or where — someone has a Gravatar. Users with a manually uploaded custom avatar are unaffected. Existing users keep their cached Gravatar-derived avatar until it's flushed; run `scripts/username_avatar_recalculate.rb` (see the file's header for the exact command) to reset everyone without a custom avatar to their username-based letter avatar.

## Telegram setup (5 minutes)

1. In Telegram, message **@BotFather**: `/newbot` → copy the token. Then `/setprivacy` → **Disable** (otherwise the bot can't read the group).
2. Add the bot to your group and make it an **admin**.
3. In Discourse: **Admin → Settings → Jtech — Disteleplus** → paste the token, pick who may use the chat (`disteleplus_allowed_groups`, default: staff), turn on `disteleplus_enabled`, press **Register Telegram webhook**.
4. In the Telegram group, send `/disteleplus_setup` and follow the short checklist (`/disteleplus_bind_general`, optionally `/disteleplus_bind_uploads`, `/disteleplus_bind_reports`).
5. Send a message from each side to check.

Known limits (Telegram's rules, not ours): the bot can't delete messages older than 48 hours, can't see when Telegram users are typing, can only show one reaction per message, and if your group is converted to a supergroup the chat ID changes — bind it again. The Reports topic needs **Topics** enabled in the group and the bot's *Manage Topics* right.

## Upgrading, rolling back, removing

- **Upgrade:** pull and `./launcher rebuild app`; migrations run automatically. The upgrade to 0.4.0 turns `mod_categories_enabled` back on if it was stored off (its sub-toggles keep whatever you set).
- **Roll back:** check out the previous commit and rebuild. Migrations aren't reverted; the added tables and columns are harmless to older code.
- **Remove / disable:** turn off `jtech_enabled` (or a single feature's switch) to stop it without losing data. Deleting the plugin from `app.yml` and rebuilding leaves its tables in place.

## Security model

- Staff/mod endpoints go through Discourse's guardian and `AdminConstraint`; Disteleplus is limited to `disteleplus_allowed_groups`, and the Telegram webhook requires its secret.
- Dumbcourse is a separate SPA with a strict CSP (own origin + hCaptcha), no cross-origin framing, and CSRF-checked writes. It only serves files from its own `public/` folder.
- Secrets (bot token, SMTP password, LanguageTool keys) are secret site settings and aren't logged.
- Report vulnerabilities as described in `SECURITY.md`.

## Notes

- Nothing here requires the official Discourse Chat plugin. If you're moving from the old Chat-based bridge, an admin can import the old channel (`POST /jtech-disteleplus/legacy-import`, check progress with `GET`) before switching Chat off. Nothing is deleted from the old Chat data.
- Screenshots of the features are in `docs/screenshots`.

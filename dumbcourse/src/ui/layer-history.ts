// while pushState() is immediate. Closing one layer and opening another in the
// same click (a menu item that opens the composer, a confirm dialog closing
// together with the composer it belongs to) used to let a late back() pop the
// new layer's entry, or a screen entry under it, and Back then left the app.
// So layers only report that the stack changed; at the end of the click the
// entries are brought to the stack depth in one go. While one of our go()
// calls is still in flight, nothing is pushed: a push now would be the entry
// that go() lands on and takes away. The sync runs again once it lands.
//
// No DOM here, so it can be unit tested.

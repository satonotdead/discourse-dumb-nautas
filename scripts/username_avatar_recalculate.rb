# New users get a username-based default avatar automatically once
# discourse_username_avatar_enabled is on. Existing users who already have a
# cached Gravatar-derived avatar keep showing it until it's explicitly
# cleared (Discourse's Gravatar fetch leaves an existing association alone on
# a 404 — it doesn't reset it). This script clears that cached association
# for every user who does NOT have a manually uploaded custom avatar, so they
# fall back to Discourse's username-based letter avatar. It intentionally
# does not delete the underlying Upload rows — only the associations that
# point a user at them — so nothing else referencing those uploads breaks.
# Idempotent — running it again just re-derives the same result.

#
# Requires the upstream discourse/discourse-translator plugin to be installed
# alongside jtech-tools — this script enqueues its DetectTranslatableLanguage
# job. It lives here next to the other translator tweak
# (sub_plugins/translator_tweaks.rb).
#
# Finds posts written in non-Latin script that have never had language detection
# run on them (no row in discourse_translator_post_locales), and enqueues the
# existing Jobs::DetectTranslatableLanguage for each, throttled to 1 per second.
# Idempotent — running it again skips posts that already have a locale row.
